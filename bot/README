The bot belongs to Sayan Choudhary. I have added following features to the bot:
1. The bot is able to recognize links given during session and store it in a seperate file in ordered sequence.
2. The bot would consider any text marked with hash tag as important and would notify every user about it also store them in a seperate log file.
3. The bot would maintain a seperate log file containing the mentors messages during the session and incase the mentor needs to repeat what he said, he would only have to give the command "repeat@n" and the previous n lines would be repeated by the bot.
