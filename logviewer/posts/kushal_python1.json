Jul 05 22:41:51 <mavu>	satya komaragiri
Jul 05 22:42:06 <kushal>	Linux users, goto terminal , run the Python interpreter with the command "python"
Jul 05 22:42:26 <kushal>	Windows guys , open the python shell from the meny 
Jul 05 22:42:29 <kushal>	* menu 
Jul 05 22:43:26 <kushal>	Everyone opened ?
Jul 05 22:43:31 <kushal>	yes/no 
Jul 05 22:43:33 <pushkal>	yes
Jul 05 22:43:34 <mavu>	ye
Jul 05 22:43:35 <amrita>	yes
Jul 05 22:43:36 <khushi_>	yes
Jul 05 22:43:40 <susenj>	yes
Jul 05 22:43:41 <rtnpro>	done
Jul 05 22:43:42 <arpita>	yes
Jul 05 22:43:51 <Prakhar>	yup
Jul 05 22:43:56 <Debashree>	yes
Jul 05 22:44:12 <kushal>	see, I told you to open the interpreter 
Jul 05 22:44:20 <Kishan>	yes
Jul 05 22:44:22 <bose_aritra>	yes
Jul 05 22:44:41 <kushal>	that means we are not going to compile the codes, we will write in the interpreter , 
Jul 05 22:45:06 <kushal>	in that way we can check every line of the code that time only 
Jul 05 22:45:29 <kushal>	You can see >>>   that is the python shell prompt
Jul 05 22:45:46 <kushal>	it means it is waiting for the command (code) to be entered 
Jul 05 22:46:21 <kushal>	Python is a dynamic language , so no need to define variables before, just use them whenever needed
Jul 05 22:46:26 <kushal>	write 
Jul 05 22:46:27 <kushal>	a = 10
Jul 05 22:47:28 <kushal>	now after this again command prompt will come 
Jul 05 22:47:49 <kushal>	To see the value of a ,just type a
Jul 05 22:47:56 <kushal>	what it is showing ?
Jul 05 22:48:00 <pushkal>	10
Jul 05 22:48:08 <pushkal>	:)
Jul 05 22:48:15 <rtnpro>	yes, 10
Jul 05 22:48:15 <kushal>	pushkal, :)
Jul 05 22:48:18 <kushal>	ok
Jul 05 22:48:21 <susenj>	10
Jul 05 22:48:30 <Kishan>	yes, 10
Jul 05 22:48:47 <kushal>	so, we never declared what is 'a',  
Jul 05 22:48:56 <kushal>	now type , a  = 2.0
Jul 05 22:49:15 <kushal>	see the value of a
Jul 05 22:49:23 <bose_aritra>	2.0
Jul 05 22:49:25 <amrita>	2.0
Jul 05 22:49:28 <rtnpro>	2.0
Jul 05 22:49:35 <susenj>	2.0
Jul 05 22:49:36 *	ria_ (n=ria@121.245.51.114) has joined #dgplug
Jul 05 22:49:40 <kushal>	ok
Jul 05 22:49:45 <kushal>	no need to type here :p
Jul 05 22:50:08 <kushal>	To see the type of a variable, use type(variable) 
Jul 05 22:50:21 <kushal>	so tell me what is the current type of a ?
Jul 05 22:50:33 <rtnpro>	float
Jul 05 22:50:33 <Kishan>	float
Jul 05 22:50:36 <arpita>	float
Jul 05 22:50:49 <susenj>	float
Jul 05 22:50:51 <pushkal>	float
Jul 05 22:50:51 <bose_aritra>	float
Jul 05 22:50:53 <kushal>	ok, make a = 10
Jul 05 22:50:57 <kushal>	and check then ?
Jul 05 22:51:06 <mavu>	int
Jul 05 22:51:08 <Kishan>	int
Jul 05 22:51:15 <kushal>	ok
Jul 05 22:51:18 <rtnpro>	int
Jul 05 22:51:19 <susenj>	'int'
Jul 05 22:51:24 <bose_aritra>	int
Jul 05 22:51:29 <pushkal>	int
Jul 05 22:51:40 <kushal>	so you can see dynamically the type of the variable is changing 
Jul 05 22:51:44 <Debashree>	int
Jul 05 22:51:59 <kushal>	Let us write the first Full program , which is Hello World
Jul 05 22:52:06 <kushal>	print "Hello World!"
Jul 05 22:52:37 <kushal>	Working ? yes/no 
Jul 05 22:52:40 <mavu>	yes
Jul 05 22:52:44 <Kishan>	yes
Jul 05 22:52:48 <rtnpro>	yes
Jul 05 22:52:48 <susenj>	ya
Jul 05 22:52:51 <arpita>	yes
Jul 05 22:52:56 <bose_aritra>	yup

Jul 05 22:53:22 <kushal>	See how easy to write helloworld code 
Jul 05 22:53:25 <Debashree>	yes
Jul 05 22:53:57 <kushal>	Now we are going to write the same program in  a file and execute it 
Jul 05 22:54:05 <kushal>	Fire up vi
Jul 05 22:54:52 <kushal>	first create a new directory to write all python codes
Jul 05 22:54:59 <kushal>	and start vi there 
Jul 05 22:55:00 <rtnpro>	what should be the ext. of the file, .py?
Jul 05 22:55:16 <kushal>	don't create all files in the same folder
Jul 05 22:55:25 <kushal>	rtnpro, I never told about anyfile
Jul 05 22:55:31 *	ria__ (n=ria@121.245.51.114) has joined #dgplug

Jul 05 22:56:17 <arpita>	!
Jul 05 22:56:31 <kushal>	Kishan, I told to write different codes in different folders, people do write all thing in the home folder only 
Jul 05 22:56:38 <kushal>	only to keep things clean 
Jul 05 22:56:42 <kushal>	arpita, yes
Jul 05 22:57:13 <kushal>	All write http://rafb.net/p/wGpQsK69.html in vi 
Jul 05 22:57:13 <arpita>	to open vi editor command in python is??
Jul 05 22:57:33 <kushal>	arpita, where do you opened vi still now /
Jul 05 22:57:33 <kushal>	?
Jul 05 22:57:54 *	munichlinux is now known as munichpython
Jul 05 22:58:11 <arpita>	so here also vi <filename> is the comm?
Jul 05 22:58:50 <kushal>	arpita, yes, you already learned vi 
Jul 05 23:00:09 <arpita>	kushal, here vi <filename> is giving syntax error
Jul 05 23:00:19 <Kishan>	!
Jul 05 23:00:40 <kushal>	arpita, yes, because you are supposed to use vi in shell, not in python interpreter 
Jul 05 23:00:44 <rtnpro>	!
Jul 05 23:00:46 <kushal>	Kishan, yes 
Jul 05 23:00:57 <Kishan>	same with me...im in windows...

Jul 05 23:01:13 <kushal>	rtnpro, yes 
Jul 05 23:01:36 <rtnpro>	kushal, I opened vi and wrote the code...how do i assign a filename to it and save it from within vi
Jul 05 23:01:49 <kushal>	rtnpro, I taught that long back 
Jul 05 23:02:09 <rtnpro>	I can do that by vi <filename>
Jul 05 23:02:13 <kushal>	anyone help rtnpro ^^ 
Jul 05 23:02:14 <kushal>	rtnpro, no

Jul 05 23:04:23 <kushal>	Ctrl + d
Jul 05 23:05:53 <kushal>	after saving that file, first give it executable permission , then run it like ./helloworld.py  (helloworld.py is the file name)
Jul 05 23:06:04 <HereBePython>	Windows guys, copy the code into a Notepad
Jul 05 23:06:27 <HereBePython>	and name it <filename>.py
Jul 05 23:06:55 <HereBePython>	if you have installed python, you should see the file icon like a python icon
Jul 05 23:07:25 <Kishan>	yes..got that
Jul 05 23:07:35 *	munichpython is now known as munichlinux

Jul 05 23:11:47 <Kishan>	ok
Jul 05 23:12:04 <kushal>	rtnpro, you go and read rishi's classes 
Jul 05 23:12:04 <HereBePython>	rtnpro, man chmod

Jul 05 23:14:48 <kushal>	Kishan, you are supposed to be in the same folder of the file 
Jul 05 23:14:53 <tuxmaniac>	Kishan: go to the directory where the file is by using "cd"
Jul 05 23:14:59 <kushal>	Kishan, first go to that directory 
Jul 05 23:15:05 <Kishan>	oh!...ok

Jul 05 23:20:33 <kushal>	In python indentation is a very critical thing

Jul 05 23:24:48 <bose_aritra>	oops
Jul 05 23:24:57 <bose_aritra>	 /*     */
Jul 05 23:25:09 <kushal>	susenj, I don't think that is allowed in C, in C++ yes 
Jul 05 23:25:15 <kushal>	tuxmaniac, ^^ am I correct ?
Jul 05 23:25:33 <susenj>	but ...it works, i  have seen
Jul 05 23:25:39 <susenj>	<eof>
Jul 05 23:25:50 <kushal>	susenj, try now in hello.c and tell us 
Jul 05 23:25:50 <pushkal>	depends on the compiler <eof>
Jul 05 23:25:56 <mavu>	/ is C++ style i guess... its perhaps because its the same compiler that both work .. @ susenj

Jul 05 23:27:51 <kushal>	anyway moving on 
Jul 05 23:27:55 <tuxmaniac>	kushal: allowed
Jul 05 23:28:10 <kushal>	tuxmaniac, for any standard ?
Jul 05 23:28:24 <kushal>	tuxmaniac, I know at least not in ansi 
Jul 05 23:28:28 <tuxmaniac>	kushal: but just not standard. For standards it is always better to use /* and */
Jul 05 23:28:38 <kushal>	tuxmaniac, ok
Jul 05 23:28:54 <kushal>	anyway 
Jul 05 23:29:10 <kushal>	you already saw how to define variables 
Jul 05 23:29:14 <kushal>	You can do like
Jul 05 23:29:19 <kushal>	a =10
Jul 05 23:29:22 <kushal>	b = 90
Jul 05 23:29:26 <kushal>	c = a + b
Jul 05 23:29:28 <kushal>	print c
Jul 05 23:29:43 *	susenj_ (n=chatzill@59.178.160.245) has joined #dgplug
Jul 05 23:30:26 <kushal>	you can assign more than one variable in a single statement 
Jul 05 23:30:45 <kushal>	a, b = 90, 23
Jul 05 23:31:16 <kushal>	^^ by using this style it is very easy to do swapping of two variables 
Jul 05 23:31:22 <kushal>	a, b = b, a
Jul 05 23:31:58 <kushal>	try above and tell me what are the values of a,b
Jul 05 23:32:12 <arpita>	a=23,b=90
Jul 05 23:32:31 <Kishan>	^^^^same
Jul 05 23:32:37 <amrita>	same
Jul 05 23:32:40 <bose_aritra>	same
Jul 05 23:32:45 <kushal>	ok, that mens values got swapped 
Jul 05 23:32:58 <Debashree>	same
Jul 05 23:33:01 <kushal>	I hope you remember how many lines you have to write in C
Jul 05 23:33:21 <bose_aritra>	:)
Jul 05 23:33:52 <rtnpro>	yes
Jul 05 23:34:12 <kushal>	Now , write one code to convert the given temperature to Celsius from Fahrenheit
Jul 05 23:34:47 <kushal>	given temp is 75.0 degree Fahrenheit
Jul 05 23:34:50 <kushal>	fast
Jul 05 23:35:04 <kushal>	and show us the rafb link

Jul 05 23:41:25 <kushal>	ok all
Jul 05 23:41:37 <susenj_>	http://rafb.net/p/OqQAtr54.html
Jul 05 23:41:50 <susenj_>	sorry...late<eof>
Jul 05 23:41:52 <arpita>	http://rafb.net/p/aumaZy21.html
Jul 05 23:41:54 <arpita>	in float
Jul 05 23:42:18 <kushal>	ok
Jul 05 23:42:22 <kushal>	moving on 
Jul 05 23:42:38 <kushal>	You can use all arithmetic operators
Jul 05 23:42:47 <kushal>	also the relational operators
Jul 05 23:43:02 <kushal>	like < , > , >= <= ...
Jul 05 23:43:27 <kushal>	/ is used to get floor division result
Jul 05 23:43:31 <kushal>	 // is used to get floor division result
Jul 05 23:43:37 <kushal>	try 
Jul 05 23:43:48 <kushal>	10.0 // 3
Jul 05 23:43:52 <kushal>	10.0 / 3

Jul 05 23:44:40 <mavu>	working
Jul 05 23:44:50 <rtnpro>	works
Jul 05 23:44:50 <susenj_>	yes
Jul 05 23:44:55 <bose_aritra>	for first case its 3, for second its 3.33333333335
Jul 05 23:44:57 <pushkal>	'/' isnt giving the floor result
Jul 05 23:45:09 <kushal>	pushkal, see the next line, that was a typo 
Jul 05 23:45:18 <pushkal>	got it kushal  !
Jul 05 23:45:49 <kushal>	There is something about True value and False value in Python 
Jul 05 23:46:05 <kushal>	We have True and False as keywords 
Jul 05 23:46:44 *	susen1 (n=student@59.178.160.245) has joined #dgplug
Jul 05 23:47:01 <kushal>	anything other than 0, False and empty default data structure, is True 
Jul 05 23:47:10 <kushal>	^^ above stated things are False
Jul 05 23:47:20 <kushal>	we will talk later on data structure 
Jul 05 23:47:41 <kushal>	You can use short hand operators like += , *=
Jul 05 23:48:15 <kushal>	We don't have character type ehere
Jul 05 23:48:25 <kushal>	here
Jul 05 23:48:27 *	susenj_ (n=chatzill@59.178.160.245) has left #dgplug
Jul 05 23:48:34 <kushal>	We have String type
Jul 05 23:48:50 <kushal>	to define a string use double or single quotes 
Jul 05 23:48:53 <kushal>	like 
Jul 05 23:49:00 <kushal>	"kushal" , 'shjakhds'
Jul 05 23:49:14 <kushal>	"I don't"
Jul 05 23:49:25 <kushal>	'Here is double quote ""'
Jul 05 23:49:48 *	susenj has quit (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out))
Jul 05 23:50:18 <kushal>	everyone ok ?
Jul 05 23:50:23 <mavu>	hmm
Jul 05 23:50:29 <Kishan>	yes
Jul 05 23:50:45 <bose_aritra>	yup
Jul 05 23:50:45 <kushal>	others ?
Jul 05 23:50:47 <susen1>	yep
Jul 05 23:51:13 <Prakhar>	yup
Jul 05 23:51:16 <arpita>	yes
Jul 05 23:51:20 <kushal>	ok
Jul 05 23:51:40 <rtnpro>	ok
Jul 05 23:52:02 <amrita>	yees
Jul 05 23:52:07 <khushi_>	yes
Jul 05 23:52:28 <kushal>	ok
Jul 05 23:52:43 <kushal>	Now I am going to talk about some basic string features
Jul 05 23:52:51 <kushal>	ask questions when I say STOP 
Jul 05 23:53:42 <kushal>	You can create strings of multiple lines using triple double quotes or triple single quotes 
Jul 05 23:54:11 <kushal>	To add(concatenation) of strings we use +
Jul 05 23:54:32 <kushal>	strings are indexed 
Jul 05 23:54:36 <kushal>	like in array in C
Jul 05 23:54:40 <kushal>	so you can do like
Jul 05 23:54:43 <kushal>	s = "abcd"
Jul 05 23:54:46 <kushal>	s[0]
Jul 05 23:54:48 *	youngling is now known as pradeepto
Jul 05 23:54:55 <kushal>	which will print a
Jul 05 23:55:40 <kushal>	to print 0 to 3rd position of the string
Jul 05 23:55:44 <kushal>	s[0:4]
Jul 05 23:55:58 <kushal>	^^ which  can written as s[:4]
Jul 05 23:56:18 <kushal>	so you can write even this s[2:4]
Jul 05 23:56:35 <kushal>	index can be negetive
Jul 05 23:56:39 *	Debashree has quit (Read error: 104 (Connection reset by peer))
Jul 05 23:56:46 <kushal>	which will be counted from the right side
Jul 05 23:56:52 <kushal>	so s[-1] will give d
Jul 05 23:57:33 <kushal>	to see the size of a string use len function 
Jul 05 23:57:36 <kushal>	len(s)
Jul 05 23:57:40 <kushal>	will give you 4
Jul 05 23:58:23 <kushal>	<STOP>
Jul 05 23:58:30 <kushal>	ask questions if any
Jul 05 23:58:32 <Kishan>	!
Jul 05 23:59:02 <rtnpro>	!
Jul 05 23:59:16 <Kishan>	cant we do s[-1:-4]
Jul 05 23:59:18 <Kishan>	?
Jul 05 23:59:35 <kushal>	Kishan, try ans see yourself 
Jul 05 23:59:39 <kushal>	rtnpro, yes
Jul 05 23:59:41 <Kishan>	result gives ' '
Jul 05 23:59:45 <Kishan>	always
Jul 06 00:00:09 <rtnpro>	whats the significance of 4 in [0:4] and [2:4]
Jul 06 00:00:12 *	Debashree (n=Debashre@61.2.164.106) has joined #dgplug
Jul 06 00:00:46 <kushal>	rtnpro, upto 4 -1 th position 
Jul 06 00:00:59 <rtnpro>	ok
Jul 06 00:01:04 <kushal>	rtnpro, so it will print like s[0], s[1], s[2], s[3]
Jul 06 00:01:16 <rtnpro>	ok thanks
Jul 06 00:01:19 <kushal>	The actual syntax for slicing is 
Jul 06 00:02:38 <kushal>	anyone else ?
Jul 06 00:02:43 <pushkal>	!
Jul 06 00:02:45 <Kishan>	!
Jul 06 00:02:53 <kushal>	pushkal, yes
Jul 06 00:02:59 <pushkal>	s[-1:-4]
Jul 06 00:03:16 <kushal>	^^ to explain this
Jul 06 00:03:23 <pushkal>	yes
Jul 06 00:03:25 <kushal>	the actual syntax is 
Jul 06 00:03:31 <kushal>	s[from , to , offset]
Jul 06 00:03:39 <kushal>	by default offset is 1
Jul 06 00:03:48 <pushkal>	oh
Jul 06 00:03:52 <kushal>	which becomes a false in ^^ case
Jul 06 00:03:58 <kushal>	so, to see from right side
Jul 06 00:04:02 <kushal>	you should write
Jul 06 00:04:06 <arpita>	!
Jul 06 00:04:32 <kushal>	s[-1:-4:-1]
Jul 06 00:04:38 <kushal>	arpita, yes please 
Jul 06 00:05:00 <arpita>	offset here means size of each slice??
Jul 06 00:05:37 <kushal>	arpita, offset means how much you want jump everytime (almost what you said )
Jul 06 00:05:46 <kushal>	all , try with a bigger string 
Jul 06 00:05:54 <kushal>	and offset like 2 or 3
Jul 06 00:06:43 <pushkal>	s[-1:-4:-1] gives 'dcb'... where is the 'a' ?
Jul 06 00:06:54 <rtnpro>	kushal, !
Jul 06 00:07:23 <kushal>	pushkal, if you start with d as -1 what is the value of a ?
Jul 06 00:07:46 <rtnpro>	kushal, does it mean that the magnitude of the value in 'to' always gets reduced by 1
Jul 06 00:07:54 <pushkal>	-4, kushal
Jul 06 00:08:02 <rtnpro>	kushal, is it?
Jul 06 00:08:20 <rtnpro>	kushal, thats why b is in -3
Jul 06 00:08:32 <kushal>	pushkal, yes, then try s[-1:-5:-1]
Jul 06 00:08:50 <pushkal>	that shows it, thanks !
Jul 06 00:08:53 <kushal>	rtnpro, yes not just reduced, but by the offset 
Jul 06 00:08:54 <rtnpro>	kushal, !
Jul 06 00:09:17 <kushal>	rtnpro, yes
