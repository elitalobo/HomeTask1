Jul 18 23:20:57 <kushal>	from there 
Jul 18 23:21:41 <ria>	kushal, you can check it

Jul 18 23:23:58 <kushal>	so, some times you need to reuse your code 
Jul 18 23:24:23 <kushal>	for that we keep the code in another file, and use from there 
Jul 18 23:24:29 <kushal>	we call them as modules
Jul 18 23:24:39 <kushal>	One module may have many files 
Jul 18 23:25:16 <kushal>	Python is so much powerful because of these so many modules available for any work 
Jul 18 23:25:57 *	munichlinux has quit (Read error: 104 (Connection reset by peer))
Jul 18 23:26:00 <kushal>	now to use any module you have to import it 
Jul 18 23:26:14 <kushal>	like to use math module
Jul 18 23:26:17 <kushal>	import math 
Jul 18 23:26:51 <kushal>	now like in you code you need to use pi 
Jul 18 23:27:00 <kushal>	so you can get that by math.pi 
Jul 18 23:27:12 <kushal>	see the value what it is showing 
Jul 18 23:27:13 <kushal>	?
Jul 18 23:27:39 <kishanGoyal>	3.1415926535897931
Jul 18 23:27:46 <kushal>	ok
Jul 18 23:28:05 <kushal>	we do have math.sin cos and other methods

Jul 18 23:34:16 <kushal>	amrita, like in a code you need to divide some value by pi
Jul 18 23:34:24 <kushal>	like 3 / math.pi
Jul 18 23:34:26 <kushal>	:)
Jul 18 23:34:48 <arpita>	!

Jul 19 01:04:14 <kushal>	anyway back to the point 
Jul 19 01:04:17 <ecntr1>	nope.. proggraming's more interesting than finance
Jul 19 01:04:41 <kushal>	there is a module called urllib2
Jul 19 01:04:46 <ecntr1>	anyway..carry on
Jul 19 01:04:53 <kushal>	which will help you to work on urls
Jul 19 01:04:55 <ecntr1>	*programming..
Jul 19 01:05:13 <kushal>	now the problem 
Jul 19 01:05:35 <kushal>	Ask the user about a company id (like WIT, IBM etc)
Jul 19 01:06:05 <kushal>	then get the details from that page using urllib2 (only get , don't show the page)
Jul 19 01:06:16 <kushal>	then show the value of the last trade 
Jul 19 01:06:25 <kushal>	^^ that is it 
Jul 19 01:06:41 <ria>	kushal, can you explain with an example please?
Jul 19 01:06:50 <kushal>	ria, ok
Jul 19 01:07:05 <arpita>	where do we get the information about functions to get these details??
Jul 19 01:07:10 <kushal>	ria, like I wrote a function called part1
Jul 19 01:07:35 <kushal>	so part1('WIT') will return 10.88
Jul 19 01:07:46 <kushal>	arpita, in the modules page
Jul 19 01:07:53 <arpita>	kushal, o.k
Jul 19 01:07:59 <kushal>	arpita, memorize docs.python.org :p
Jul 19 01:08:04 <kushal>	arpita, for this case http://docs.python.org/lib/module-urllib2.html
Jul 19 01:08:14 <kushal>	Debashree, you can also try this from windows 
Jul 19 01:08:33 <Debashree>	kushal, ok :)
Jul 19 01:10:23 *	Soumya has quit (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out))
Jul 19 01:10:57 <kushal>	ok, some hints again 
Jul 19 01:11:03 <kushal>	to read a page
Jul 19 01:11:05 <kushal>	do like
Jul 19 01:11:25 <kushal>	link = urllib2.urlopen("http://dgplug.org")
Jul 19 01:11:32 <kushal>	data = link.read()
Jul 19 01:11:41 <kushal>	now data contains the webpage
Jul 19 01:11:54 <kushal>	you just have to *find* the right data from it 
Jul 19 01:13:21 <ecntr1>	kushal tell me one thing, how to join 2 strings.
Jul 19 01:13:33 <kushal>	ecntr1, + 
Jul 19 01:13:39 <kushal>	ecntr1, :p
Jul 19 01:13:55 <ecntr1>	no.. i have 2 string variables.. a, b.
Jul 19 01:14:00 <ecntr1>	how do i join them?
Jul 19 01:14:06 <ecntr1>	only a+b?
Jul 19 01:14:10 <kushal>	yes
Jul 19 01:14:14 <kushal>	c = a + b
Jul 19 01:14:41 <Prakhar>	ecntr1: power of python!

Jul 19 01:22:30 <arpita>	kushal, why are  we writing data = none in last line?
Jul 19 01:22:46 <kushal>	arpita, actually we don't need it
Jul 19 01:22:56 <kushal>	ecntr1, data's default value is none
Jul 19 01:23:06 <ecntr1>	ok kushal
Jul 19 01:23:08 <kushal>	ecntr1, so you can just call it with url
Jul 19 01:23:10 <ria>	kushal, http://rafb.net/p/qD9TFi56.html
Jul 19 01:23:22 <ria>	can i approach in this way?

Jul 19 01:26:59 <ecntr1>	ok.
Jul 19 01:27:25 <amrita_>	kushal, so there should be a "plus" before id?
Jul 19 01:27:45 <kushal>	amrita_, don't think like that 
Jul 19 01:28:06 <kushal>	amrita_, think you have to add the value of id to the string, how you should do it 
Jul 19 01:28:11 <kushal>	amrita_, + only :)
Jul 19 01:29:06 <amrita_>	kushal, yes that only i meant

Jul 19 01:29:38 <ecntr1>	kushal: I didn't understand what else have to be written...
Jul 19 01:30:09 <kushal>	ecntr1, you have to find the value of "Last Trade" from that page 
Jul 19 01:30:36 <ria>	kushal, i did something and got a large html value
Jul 19 01:30:45 <ria>	perhaps the page source

Jul 19 01:32:22 <ria>	ok kushal
Jul 19 01:32:31 <ria>	but what will i actually do?

Jul 19 01:51:00 *	amrita has quit (Read error: 104 (Connection reset by peer))
Jul 19 01:51:15 <ria>	kushal, i am unable to understand how to get the value
Jul 19 01:51:27 <kushal>	Kkhushi_, tell us what was your idea 
Jul 19 01:52:28 <Kkhushi_>	kushal as we have the html file as string in data
Jul 19 01:52:49 <Kkhushi_>	we cah find the position of Last Trade in the string
Jul 19 01:53:04 <Kkhushi_>	using .find()
Jul 19 01:53:19 <kushal>	Kkhushi_, yes, correct 
Jul 19 01:53:26 <Kkhushi_>	but then i dont know what to do with it
Jul 19 01:53:43 <Kkhushi_>	i mean i have some idea but it seems little clumsy
Jul 19 01:53:46 *	amritaaa has quit (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out))
Jul 19 01:54:15 <kushal>	Kkhushi_, yes, its ok, from that you can try to find a way to solve :p
Jul 19 01:54:30 <Kkhushi_>	we can get the next 20 characters from the file from that position
Jul 19 01:54:39 <kushal>	Kkhushi_, yes 
Jul 19 01:55:00 <Kkhushi_>	this will reduce our work string
Jul 19 01:55:03 <kushal>	Kkhushi_, yes
Jul 19 01:55:15 <kushal>	Kkhushi_, I followed almost the same way :p
Jul 19 01:55:39 <Prakhar>	me too
Jul 19 01:56:10 *	amritaa_ has quit (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out))
Jul 19 01:56:45 <kushal>	Prakhar, :)
Jul 19 01:56:49 <ecntr1>	kushal: can you please help me with find()? I don't know the syntax
Jul 19 01:56:54 *	Prakhar is now known as PR4KH4R
Jul 19 01:56:54 <arpita>	Kkhushi_, please tell how do we find position of last trade in data using .find()??
Jul 19 01:56:59 <kushal>	ecntr1, help(str.find)
Jul 19 01:57:07 <ecntr1>	ok
Jul 19 01:57:17 <kushal>	arpita, help(str.find)
Jul 19 01:57:20 <kushal>	:p
Jul 19 01:57:28 <PR4KH4R>	guys, "help"
Jul 19 01:57:34 <Kkhushi_>	i did the same help(str)
Jul 19 01:57:56 *	Debashree_ (n=Debashre@117.201.96.31) has joined #dgplug
Jul 19 01:58:10 <Kkhushi_>	when kushal gave the hint that its a string now
Jul 19 01:58:26 *	Debashree has quit (Nick collision from services.)
Jul 19 01:58:37 *	Debashree_ is now known as Debashree
Jul 19 01:58:42 <Kkhushi_>	help(str)
Jul 19 01:58:52 <Kkhushi_>	oops sorry

Jul 19 02:03:57 <arpita>	Kkhushi_,  in help(str.find)..  S.find(sub [,start [,end]]) -> int    what does sub mean over here?
Jul 19 02:04:20 <Kkhushi_>	sub means substring we want to find
Jul 19 02:04:32 <kushal>	arpita, ^^ written there :p
Jul 19 02:05:00 <Kkhushi_>	start and end are indices which are optional
Jul 19 02:05:33 <ria>	kushal, can you please say me how to return...
Jul 19 02:05:49 <kushal>	ria, return 
Jul 19 02:05:53 <ria>	a string at any paricular position
Jul 19 02:06:29 <ria>	kushal, ^^
Jul 19 02:06:49 <kushal>	if the string is s
Jul 19 02:06:50 <kushal>	then 
Jul 19 02:07:13 <kushal>	s[10:20] will give from 10th position to 19th position 
Jul 19 02:07:40 <ria>	ya ok thanks
Jul 19 02:07:46 <ria>	i was searching just
Jul 19 02:07:48 <ria>	:)
Jul 19 02:08:19 <Kkhushi_>	kushal can we just strip all the characters other than digits
Jul 19 02:08:53 *	amritaaa (n=amrita@117.201.96.101) has joined #dgplug
Jul 19 02:09:29 <kushal>	Kkhushi_, yes
Jul 19 02:09:58 <Kkhushi_>	kushal, is there a simple way to write it
Jul 19 02:10:23 <kushal>	Kkhushi_, not much, you have to find a way 
Jul 19 02:10:33 <kushal>	Kkhushi_, I tried with some hard coded values :
Jul 19 02:10:42 *	amritas (n=amrita@117.201.96.93) has joined #dgplug
Jul 19 02:11:43 <ecntr1>	kushal:  I've used find to get the index of Last Trade in that html file
Jul 19 02:11:49 <ria>	kushal, i think i got it
Jul 19 02:11:57 <ria>	let me write the code and check
Jul 19 02:12:02 <kushal>	ecntr1, yes 
Jul 19 02:12:15 <ecntr1>	but.. how do I strip any other values except integer?
Jul 19 02:12:17 <kushal>	ecntr1, and then the value after that somehow
Jul 19 02:12:27 <ecntr1>	i mean numbers..
Jul 19 02:12:27 <kushal>	ecntr1, that is the problem :p
Jul 19 02:12:34 *	amrita_ has quit (Read error: 104 (Connection reset by peer))
Jul 19 02:12:34 <ecntr1>	:(
Jul 19 02:12:44 <ecntr1>	I'm stuck into that..
Jul 19 02:13:07 <ecntr1>	It seems like ria has got it..:)
Jul 19 02:13:30 <ria>	i have to code ecntr1
Jul 19 02:13:34 <ria>	logic works
Jul 19 02:13:55 <ecntr1>	:)
Jul 19 02:17:38 <ria>	kushal,
Jul 19 02:17:43 <kushal>	ria, yes
Jul 19 02:17:47 <ria>	http://rafb.net/p/ipmvxQ34.html
Jul 19 02:17:50 <ria>	kushal, check it
Jul 19 02:17:58 <ria>	it is not working
Jul 19 02:18:06 <ria>	but the logic think is ok
Jul 19 02:18:35 <ria>	i used a small string with this logic and it works fine kushal
Jul 19 02:18:50 <ria>	kushal, i used the page source
Jul 19 02:19:01 <kushal>	ria, logic is almost ok :)
Jul 19 02:19:03 <ria>	kushal, did you understand it?
Jul 19 02:19:07 <kushal>	ria, try with http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=TCS.NS
Jul 19 02:19:11 <kushal>	ria, no :)
Jul 19 02:19:28 <ria>	kushal, i did x + 74
Jul 19 02:19:32 <kushal>	yes
Jul 19 02:19:37 <ria>	as i counted in page source
Jul 19 02:19:50 <ria>	how far is it from last trade
Jul 19 02:20:04 <ria>	i mean the value 10
Jul 19 02:20:15 <kushal>	ria, count count :p
Jul 19 02:20:16 <ria>	kushal, ^^
Jul 19 02:20:22 <ria>	ya count
Jul 19 02:20:22 <kushal>	this is a nice problem 
Jul 19 02:20:24 <kushal>	:p
Jul 19 02:20:26 <ecntr1>	yeh.. but in my case.. not working
Jul 19 02:20:39 <ria>	ecntr1, its not working either
Jul 19 02:20:40 <PR4KH4R>	kushal: shouldn't the solution be generic
Jul 19 02:20:45 <ecntr1>	ria: you must have made some mistake counting..
Jul 19 02:20:51 <ria>	kushal, but see it should work
Jul 19 02:21:00 <kushal>	PR4KH4R, yes
Jul 19 02:21:03 <ria>	ecntr1, anyways it should show something
Jul 19 02:21:05 <ecntr1>	yah ria..
Jul 19 02:21:16 <ria>	ecntr1, actually not showing now
Jul 19 02:21:32 *	amrita has quit (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out))
Jul 19 02:21:32 <ria>	ecntr1, otherwise i can change the values to get the desired
Jul 19 02:21:37 <ecntr1>	ria: you'r logic is right.. just we have to count good..:)
Jul 19 02:21:44 <kushal>	ecntr1, correct 
Jul 19 02:21:46 <Kkhushi_>	kushal, shouldn't it be located through programming
Jul 19 02:21:50 <PR4KH4R>	kushal: so, hard coding the values like "74" should be discouraged
Jul 19 02:21:57 <kushal>	Kkhushi_, yes 
Jul 19 02:21:58 <ria>	ecntr1, ya i know the counting part is bad
Jul 19 02:22:09 <ecntr1>	:)
Jul 19 02:22:13 <kushal>	Kkhushi_, PR4KH4R but you can hard code some amount 
Jul 19 02:22:26 <kushal>	Kkhushi_, which will not effect any thing 
Jul 19 02:22:26 <ria>	kushal, but in the page source a number is encountered earlier
Jul 19 02:22:32 <ecntr1>	PR4KH4R: Mate.. you suggest a better way..:)
Jul 19 02:22:52 <PR4KH4R>	ecntr1: thinking buddy :)
Jul 19 02:22:59 <ria>	so i could not wait for a number to come kushal
Jul 19 02:23:00 <ecntr1>	PR4KH4R: we're working hard on it mate..
Jul 19 02:23:06 <ria>	kushal, did you get that
Jul 19 02:23:08 <ria>	?
Jul 19 02:23:11 <kushal>	ria, no, 
Jul 19 02:23:19 <kushal>	ria, I am just waiting for a resultr 
Jul 19 02:23:22 <ecntr1>	PR4KH4R: and ria made a significant code..
Jul 19 02:23:32 <ecntr1>	kushal: :)
Jul 19 02:23:45 <kushal>	as I am still in office 
Jul 19 02:23:46 <kushal>	:D
Jul 19 02:23:59 <ria>	kushal, can you say why is it not giving any output?
Jul 19 02:24:03 <PR4KH4R>	ecntr1: yeah, right
Jul 19 02:24:14 <kushal>	ria, no idea
Jul 19 02:24:28 <ecntr1>	ria..
Jul 19 02:24:32 <ria>	kushal, let me do in interpreter, it may work
Jul 19 02:24:34 <kushal>	ria, what is the input 
Jul 19 02:24:35 <ria>	ecntr1, :)
Jul 19 02:24:38 <kushal>	ria, yes
Jul 19 02:24:42 <ria>	WIT
Jul 19 02:24:44 <kushal>	ok
Jul 19 02:24:53 <ecntr1>	i think you should assign a variable and then add 5 into it..
Jul 19 02:25:02 <ecntr1>	not data[a:5]
Jul 19 02:25:14 <kushal>	ria, btw, you should paste without the line numbers, or else I can not test the code
Jul 19 02:25:15 <ecntr1>	i mean aa=a+5
Jul 19 02:25:20 <ecntr1>	then data[a:aa]
Jul 19 02:25:25 <ria>	ya i know
Jul 19 02:25:30 <ria>	sorry kushal
Jul 19 02:25:36 <kushal>	ecntr1, yes, just have to find a and aa :
Jul 19 02:25:37 <kushal>	:p
Jul 19 02:25:39 <ria>	i was in a hurry to paste that's why
Jul 19 02:25:46 <kushal>	ria, no problem  :p
Jul 19 02:25:54 <ria>	:)
Jul 19 02:25:57 <kushal>	ria, to disable nu in vi , :set nu!
Jul 19 02:26:09 <ria>	ya i always do that
Jul 19 02:26:20 <ria>	when i show something
Jul 19 02:26:29 <ria>	but now i am thinking only here
Jul 19 02:26:30 <ria>	:P
Jul 19 02:29:21 *	amritaaa has quit (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out))
Jul 19 02:30:24 <ria>	kushal, when i did in interpreter it gave ' '
Jul 19 02:30:50 <kushal>	ok
Jul 19 02:30:51 <kushal>	:p
Jul 19 02:31:22 <ria>	kushal, the logic is right i think, still not working
Jul 19 02:31:27 <kushal>	:)
Jul 19 02:31:31 <ria>	kushal, http://rafb.net/p/nH3ecC83.html
Jul 19 02:31:34 <ria>	check it
Jul 19 02:31:41 *	amritas has quit (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out))
Jul 19 02:31:42 <ria>	i removed the line numbers
Jul 19 02:31:44 <kushal>	ria, then there is some problem in the logic :po
Jul 19 02:31:46 <ria>	the same code
Jul 19 02:32:08 <ria>	kushal, but i used a small string and it worked
Jul 19 02:32:13 <ria>	the last part
Jul 19 02:32:47 <kushal>	ria, why you are sending data="Last Trade" ?
Jul 19 02:33:24 <ria>	kushal, it was working
Jul 19 02:33:28 <kushal>	eh
Jul 19 02:33:33 <ecntr1>	kushal.. i got it.
Jul 19 02:33:44 <ria>	kushal, it was giving the page source
Jul 19 02:33:47 <kushal>	ria, don't do only if it is working 
Jul 19 02:33:48 <ria>	earlier
Jul 19 02:33:56 <ria>	ok kushal
Jul 19 02:34:00 <kushal>	ria, it may harm somewhere else
Jul 19 02:34:06 <kushal>	ecntr1, tell 
Jul 19 02:34:09 <kushal>	rather shwo 
Jul 19 02:34:10 <kushal>	show 
Jul 19 02:34:17 <ria>	kushal, should i remove the request part?
Jul 19 02:34:22 <ria>	kushal, ?
Jul 19 02:34:33 <kushal>	you can 
Jul 19 02:34:33 <ecntr1>	http://rafb.net/p/xtKkLh21.html
Jul 19 02:34:45 <ria>	ok
Jul 19 02:34:46 <ecntr1>	it's the experiment version.. it's working well
Jul 19 02:35:06 <ecntr1>	wait for the more sophistication...:)
Jul 19 02:35:16 <kushal>	hehe
Jul 19 02:35:31 <PR4KH4R>	he he
Jul 19 02:35:38 <kushal>	ecntr1, will it work with http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=TCS.NS

Jul 19 02:37:42 <ecntr1>	:)
Jul 19 02:37:44 <ria>	kushal, will link.read() give the page source?
Jul 19 02:37:59 <ria>	ecntr1, why did you use 129?
Jul 19 02:38:12 <ria>	kushal, ?
Jul 19 02:38:16 <ecntr1>	?
Jul 19 02:38:18 <ecntr1>	129?
