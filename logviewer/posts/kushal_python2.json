Jul 06 19:33:24 <rtnpro>	kushal, !
Jul 06 19:33:31 <kushal>	rtnpro, yes 
Jul 06 19:34:01 <rtnpro>	kushal, I have some doubts regarding tags...I faced those while writing for the wiki
Jul 06 19:34:11 <rtnpro>	kushal, can you help me after the class
Jul 06 19:34:20 <kushal>	rtnpro, they are not part of my python session 
Jul 06 19:34:22 <kushal>	rtnpro, ok
Jul 06 19:34:35 <kushal>	So, about control flow in python
Jul 06 19:34:53 <ria>	kushal, i missed the roll call
Jul 06 19:35:01 <kushal>	You already know we can use if,else in C 
Jul 06 19:35:11 <kushal>	ria, yes
Jul 06 19:35:20 <kushal>	It is same in python also 
Jul 06 19:35:20 <ria>	kushal, Ria Das
Jul 06 19:35:38 <kushal>	the syntax is
Jul 06 19:35:45 <kushal>	if condition:
Jul 06 19:35:50 <kushal>	    statement
Jul 06 19:35:52 <kushal>	else:
Jul 06 19:35:56 <kushal>	    statement 
Jul 06 19:36:11 <kushal>	look ^^ at the : and the spaces before statements 
Jul 06 19:36:28 <kushal>	in Python we create blocks of code using spaces
Jul 06 19:36:36 <kushal>	in C we use {}
Jul 06 19:36:47 <kushal>	so, let us see in an example
Jul 06 19:36:50 <kushal>	n = 10
Jul 06 19:36:55 <kushal>	if n < 100:
Jul 06 19:37:02 <kushal>	    print "Lesser than"
Jul 06 19:37:03 <kushal>	else:
Jul 06 19:37:12 <kushal>	    print "Greater than"
Jul 06 19:37:16 <kushal>	try ^^ 
Jul 06 19:37:57 <kushal>	ask if you have any questions 
Jul 06 19:38:18 <sunny_slls>	!
Jul 06 19:38:25 <kushal>	sunny_slls, yes

Jul 06 19:39:28 <kushal>	arpita, 
Jul 06 19:39:31 <sunny_slls>	the spaces we use in place of {} are not understood
Jul 06 19:39:44 <kushal>	in C we use {}
Jul 06 19:39:46 <kushal>	like 
Jul 06 19:39:52 <kushal>	if (n < 100)
Jul 06 19:39:53 <arpita>	how to mark the closing of the if statement??

Jul 06 19:40:17 <kushal>	here we use spaces to create blocks
Jul 06 19:40:22 <Kishan>	!
Jul 06 19:40:24 <kushal>	so after an if statement

Jul 06 19:40:55 <rtnpro>	kushal, !
Jul 06 19:41:08 <kushal>	^^ if I start with four spaces, all lines with 4 spaces will be part of that if condition 
Jul 06 19:41:38 <kushal>	the next statement which will start from the beginning will be out of if statement 
Jul 06 19:41:46 <rtnpro>	kushal, !
Jul 06 19:41:53 <kushal>	rtnpro, later
Jul 06 19:41:59 <kushal>	arpita, ^^ 
Jul 06 19:42:02 <kushal>	susenj, yes
Jul 06 19:42:06 <sunny_slls>	means each and every line should have same no. of spaces
Jul 06 19:42:10 <susenj>	kushal...it's working...but tell me whether the colon(:) shows the end of a condition only?
Jul 06 19:42:11 <kushal>	sunny_slls, correct 
Jul 06 19:42:35 <rtnpro>	kushal, I have a q. regarding this topic
Jul 06 19:42:43 <kushal>	susenj, no, every time we create such blocks like in function , conditions, classes , everywhere you have to use :
Jul 06 19:42:52 <kushal>	rtnpro, wait for your turn 
Jul 06 19:43:00 <kushal>	Kishan, yes 
Jul 06 19:43:17 <Kishan>	kushal, ..nothing ..its clear
Jul 06 19:43:27 <kushal>	Kishan, ok
Jul 06 19:43:30 <kushal>	rtnpro, yes 
Jul 06 19:43:34 <rtnpro>	kushal, Is a white space sufficient or it is a number of spaces equivalent to tab
Jul 06 19:44:19 <kushal>	rtnpro, tab is also a kind of white space 
Jul 06 19:44:30 <rtnpro>	or we decide the no. of spaces but for a block as sunny_slls  said it should be constant?
Jul 06 19:44:31 <kushal>	rtnpro, better use 4whitespaces 
Jul 06 19:44:38 <rtnpro>	ok
Jul 06 19:44:43 <rtnpro>	kushal, thanks
Jul 06 19:44:49 <kushal>	rtnpro, it depends on your style 
Jul 06 19:44:59 <rtnpro>	ok
Jul 06 19:45:05 <susenj>	!
Jul 06 19:45:10 <sunny_slls>	kushal, !
Jul 06 19:45:35 <kushal>	http://tv.dgplug.org/devel-inside.html here you find a video on if-else (for broadband users)
Jul 06 19:45:41 <kushal>	susenj, yes
Jul 06 19:45:47 <susenj>	kushal,but pressing tab doesn't provide spaces  rather showing a message
Jul 06 19:46:02 <susenj>	Display all 168 possibilities? (y or n)
Jul 06 19:46:05 <susenj>	<eof>
Jul 06 19:46:19 <sunny_slls>	amrita, tell me quickly that what was the last topic told in python
Jul 06 19:46:37 <rtnpro>	susenj, in python it does create space
Jul 06 19:46:53 <kushal>	sunny_slls, talk in pm '
Jul 06 19:47:03 <kushal>	susenj, in the python interpreter ?
Jul 06 19:47:03 <rtnpro>	susenj, but not in the terminal...it gives options
Jul 06 19:47:13 <kushal>	sunny_slls, better use 4 blank spaces 
Jul 06 19:47:16 <susenj>	rtnpro,i have tried tab on python prompt and got that message
Jul 06 19:47:47 <kushal>	susenj, use 4 blank spaces
Jul 06 19:47:53 <kushal>	susenj, understood 
Jul 06 19:48:00 <susenj>	kushal,okay
Jul 06 19:48:13 <susenj>	i used 3 spaces this time
Jul 06 19:48:16 <susenj>	<eof>
Jul 06 19:48:36 <kushal>	susenj, use 4 , which much standard 
Jul 06 19:49:02 <susenj>	ok.kushal,i will...from now onwards
Jul 06 19:50:49 <kushal>	ok
Jul 06 19:50:52 <kushal>	anything else ?
Jul 06 19:51:06 <Kishan>	no
Jul 06 19:51:20 <rtnpro>	no,
Jul 06 19:51:33 <kushal>	ok

Jul 06 19:55:47 <kushal>	sunny_slls, thats why you should attend the sessions 
Jul 06 19:56:13 <sunny_slls>	kushal, i told you the problems
Jul 06 19:56:31 <kushal>	sunny_slls, not mine, you have to solve them

Jul 06 19:59:54 <kushal>	ok, moving on 
Jul 06 19:59:58 <kushal>	Looping 
Jul 06 20:00:19 <kushal>	you all know how loops are required to solve problems

Jul 06 20:00:36 <kushal>	So, first we are going to look into while loop
Jul 06 20:00:39 <kushal>	syntax is
Jul 06 20:00:44 <kushal>	while condition:
Jul 06 20:00:49 <kushal>	    statement1
Jul 06 20:00:55 <kushal>	    statement2
Jul 06 20:01:25 <kushal>	so, if I want to write a while loop to print 0 to 10
Jul 06 20:01:28 <kushal>	n = 0
Jul 06 20:01:40 <kushal>	while n < 11:
Jul 06 20:01:45 <kushal>	    print n
Jul 06 20:01:53 <kushal>	    n += 1

Jul 06 20:32:14 <kushal>	it is way to store data, and access/modify that data  
Jul 06 20:32:34 <kushal>	There are different kinds of Data Structure 
Jul 06 20:32:44 <kushal>	we will learn one of them today 
Jul 06 20:32:53 <kushal>	Its a python thing called list 
Jul 06 20:33:11 <kushal>	Lists can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets. 
Jul 06 20:33:29 <kushal>	like a = [1, 2, 3455, "dhe", 233]
Jul 06 20:33:30 <kushal>	a
Jul 06 20:33:38 <kushal>	try type(a)
Jul 06 20:33:49 <kushal>	lists are sequence too 
Jul 06 20:33:56 <kushal>	that means you can slice them 
Jul 06 20:34:09 <kushal>	a[0:4]
Jul 06 20:34:12 <kushal>	a[4]
Jul 06 20:34:24 <kushal>	you can even change values in a list 
Jul 06 20:34:25 <kushal>	like 
Jul 06 20:34:32 <kushal>	a[2] = 345
Jul 06 20:34:38 <kushal>	try try 
Jul 06 20:34:54 <kushal>	to see length of a list , use len() function \
Jul 06 20:35:42 <kushal>	ask questions if any

Jul 06 20:37:12 <kushal>	Kishan, we can concat two lists 
Jul 06 20:37:26 <kushal>	or even more number of lists
Jul 06 20:37:28 <kushal>	susenj, yes
Jul 06 20:37:33 <susenj>	this list is quite different from a linked list?
Jul 06 20:38:28 <mavu>	!
Jul 06 20:38:39 <kushal>	susenj, not much, but here everything is ready, you just have to use it 
Jul 06 20:38:53 <kushal>	susenj, plus it has many useful methods
Jul 06 20:39:03 <kushal>	susenj, which we will see later

Jul 06 20:39:30 <kushal>	amrita, yes
Jul 06 20:39:59 <amrita>	kushal, that will be the output?
Jul 06 20:40:15 <kushal>	amrita, yes, as we are learning lists here

Jul 06 20:41:46 <sunny_slls>	i can't understand please show an example
Jul 06 20:42:06 <kushal>	sunny_slls, please wait , if asked then only speak 
Jul 06 20:42:18 <kushal>	sunny_slls, btw, I typed example only

Jul 06 20:42:44 <mavu_>	sorry got dc.. hmm.. i tried >>> a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
Jul 06 20:42:45 <mavu_>	>>> type(a)
Jul 06 20:42:45 <mavu_>	<type 'list'>
Jul 06 20:42:45 <mavu_>	 are there no arrays?
Jul 06 20:43:06 <kushal>	mavu_, no 
Jul 06 20:43:17 <kushal>	mavu_, and use rafb :p
Jul 06 20:43:22 <mavu_>	okay <EOF>
Jul 06 20:43:31 <mavu_>	sorry my bad.. again
Jul 06 20:43:34 <kushal>	mavu_, but this list works for array :)
Jul 06 20:43:52 <kushal>	sunny_slls, shoot

Jul 06 20:46:54 <kushal>	it works on a list 
Jul 06 20:46:59 <kushal>	so one example 
Jul 06 20:47:10 <kushal>	a = [1, 3, 5, 7]
Jul 06 20:47:15 <kushal>	for  x in a:

Jul 06 20:47:23 <kushal>	^^ try that 
Jul 06 20:47:31 <kushal>	take some different list and try 
Jul 06 20:48:25 <amrita>	done
Jul 06 20:48:59 <rtnpro_>	yes donw

Jul 06 20:49:55 <kushal>	I almost slept :(
Jul 06 20:50:10 <arpita>	kushal, what if we want to print only selected values of this list using for command??
Jul 06 20:50:37 <kushal>	arpita, like only vales greater than 100
Jul 06 20:50:53 <kushal>	a = [1, 345, 34, 209, 677,12,34]
Jul 06 20:50:57 <kushal>	for x in a:
Jul 06 20:51:04 <kushal>	    if x > 100:
Jul 06 20:51:08 <kushal>	        print x
Jul 06 20:51:12 <kushal>	arpita, ^^ 
Jul 06 20:51:26 <rtnpro_>	kushal, can we use here for x in a[0:4]:
Jul 06 20:51:38 <rtnpro_>	kushal, !
Jul 06 20:51:45 <kushal>	rtnpro_, to get 0 to 3rd column , yes
Jul 06 20:51:58 <rtnpro_>	ok
Jul 06 20:52:10 <kushal>	there is function called range
Jul 06 20:52:16 <kushal>	range(0,10):
Jul 06 20:52:27 <kushal>	range(0,10)
Jul 06 20:52:35 <kushal>	so you can do 
Jul 06 20:52:45 <kushal>	for i in range(0,10):
Jul 06 20:52:48 <kushal>	    print i

Jul 06 20:56:00 <kushal>	amrita, 
Jul 06 20:56:21 <amrita>	there is no need of writing print i
Jul 06 20:56:34 <amrita>	without it getting the output

Jul 06 20:57:11 <rtnpro_>	amrita, but in my case there was syntax error
Jul 06 20:57:11 <kushal>	amrita, range function returns a list , but to print the values of the list , you have to print them 
Jul 06 20:57:20 <amrita>	range(0,10) and then on pressing enter output is there
Jul 06 20:57:23 <rtnpro_>	kushal, !
Jul 06 20:57:23 <kushal>	sunny_slls, shoot 
Jul 06 20:57:35 <sunny_slls>	same case\
Jul 06 20:57:38 <kushal>	amrita, is it same with the code I wrote above ?
Jul 06 20:57:48 <kushal>	sunny_slls, which same case ?
Jul 06 20:58:02 <amrita>	kushal, i have written different
Jul 06 20:58:07 <amrita>	kushal, let me check
Jul 06 20:58:19 <sunny_slls>	why are we writing range two times?
Jul 06 20:58:22 <kushal>	rtnpro_, 
Jul 06 20:58:25 *	mavu has quit (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out))
Jul 06 20:58:37 <kushal>	sunny_slls, I just wrote, no reason

Jul 06 20:59:10 <amrita>	kushal, !
Jul 06 20:59:18 <kushal>	mavu_, yes
Jul 06 20:59:24 <rtnpro_>	kushal, I had the same query as amrita's but in my case there was syntax error?
Jul 06 20:59:36 <mavu_>	when i try without print i it gives me an error saying expected an indented block
Jul 06 20:59:47 <kushal>	rtnpro_, please paste and give us link
Jul 06 20:59:49 <amrita>	!
Jul 06 21:00:06 <kushal>	mavu_, yes, as it is expecting some statement inside if block

Jul 06 21:00:13 <rtnpro_>	kushal, I think printing is mandatory when I use for x in a:
Jul 06 21:00:14 <kushal>	amrita, yes please 
Jul 06 21:00:18 <rtnpro_>	kushal, is it so?'
Jul 06 21:00:30 <kushal>	rtnpro_, no, you can do anything inside that loop
Jul 06 21:00:32 <kushal>	like
Jul 06 21:00:37 <kushal>	for x in a:
Jul 06 21:00:37 <amrita>	kushal, i have done range(0,10) without the colon
Jul 06 21:00:50 <kushal>	    b  = 90
Jul 06 21:01:03 <kushal>	amrita, yes, you called the function 
Jul 06 21:01:05 <amrita>	kushal, then there is no error
Jul 06 21:01:23 <kushal>	amrita, yes, that colon was typo
Jul 06 21:01:28 <amrita>	kushal, without writing print i
Jul 06 21:01:37 <amrita>	kushal, i got output
Jul 06 21:01:48 <rtnpro_>	kushal, http://rafb.net/p/ZJzY5z11.html
Jul 06 21:01:49 <kushal>	amrita,  is it same with the code I wrote ?
Jul 06 21:01:57 <techno_freak>	amrita, if you do it in interactive prompt you will
Jul 06 21:02:11 <kushal>	amrita, that will return you a list

Jul 06 21:02:38 <rtnpro_>	Its clear now
Jul 06 21:02:47 <amrita>	kushal, i am getting the list

Jul 06 21:03:22 <kushal>	amrita, in the code ?
Jul 06 21:03:50 <amrita>	kushal, of which code are you talking about
Jul 06 21:03:56 <amrita>	kushal, i am confused
Jul 06 21:03:58 <kushal>	amrita, see http://rafb.net/p/AMYRHB75.html  , first range returns a list 
Jul 06 21:04:11 <kushal>	amrita, the example of for loop 
Jul 06 21:04:15 <kushal>	using range
Jul 06 21:04:19 <amrita>	ok
Jul 06 21:04:39 <rtnpro_>	kushal, see this http://rafb.net/p/eJ5d5v78.html
